This lab is to get you started in learning Static Pages.  Between each change you should refresh your
browser to observe changes.  If that doesn't work try restarting the server.

Starting with Routing:
  When you first run the rails server command we get the general rails page.  However if we look
  around our app there is already a static_pages controller (app/controllers/static_pages_controller.rb)
  and a view for the static page that corresponds to home (app/views/static_pages/home.html.erb).
  Let's make that our home page, aka our root url.  In your config/routes.rb between the header
  and the end type in
    root 'static_pages#home'
  and save.  Restart your server/refresh your browser and your new home page should show up.

Updating the Landing Page:
  The HTML is always found in the views of your rails application.  To find the HTML
  file of your home page you have to go to app/views.  Since this home page is handled
  by the static_pages controller then we go into the static_pages folder within app/views.
  There should be two files in here, one named home.html.erb and one named about.html.erb.
  The one we want to open is home.html.erb.

  First let's personalize the landing page a little.  On line 10 there is the line:
    <a class="navbar-brand" href="/">Start Bootstrap</a>
  This is an a tag, which signifies it is a link.  Class signifies the css class or
  classes it has and href is where it actually linkes to.
  Let's rebrand it from Start Bootstrap to something fun.  Replace it with anything
  you want.  In lines 37 and 38 there are the lines:
    <h1>Your Landing Page</h1>
    <h3> A template for the Rails Decal Lab</h3>
  These h1 and h3 tags signifies headers.  They contain the text that appears on your
  banner.  Update these to something fun as well.


Your favorite Animal:
  Did you notice that little cat at the bottom of the page?  Well since it is your page you should update
  it to your favorite animal.  First let's find the h2 tag in the Home page and change the contents of it
  to your favorite animal.  In the p tag right below it explain why it is.

  Now let's look at the image tag below it:
    <img class="img-responsive" src="http://confrazzled.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cat2.jpg" alt="">
  If we look at this tag it seems like we are getting the cat image from 
    http://confrazzled.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cat2.jpg
  Let's change the image by finding the image of your favorite animal.  Refresh your page to see if it
  worked.

Your About page:
  Currently if you click on the About tab in your nav bar you can't find the page.  This is because it is
  not in our routes file.  Add a route (using either get or match) to the about page.  Remember the format
  is:
    get '/about', to: '{controller}#{function}'
  where we replace the curly brackets and everything between them with the proper names.  To figure out
  what to put in there look in the app/controllers folder and look at the static_pages_controller.rb.  After
  you route the GET request for '/about' to the proper controller function, restart the server and test if you
  can reach the About page through the About tab.

  This about page contains alot less styling and is super basic.  Find the about page in your view folder
  (app/views/static_pages) and simply change your name.

Doing some ERB:
  Now we want to fill in our Major and Age (which is blank and 7 respectively).  Let's try and do this
  without changing the HTML and just using our controller.  If we open app/views/static_pages/about.html.erb
  we see there our two place holders in the embedded ruby.  Notice the @ at the beginning of these variables.
  These signifies we defined these in our controller.  Edit the controller and update/create the @variables
  so that the About page contains the correct information.

Adding CSS classes:
  If you look at the app/views/static_pages/about.html.erb there is an empty image tag at the bottom.
  Add the css class "circular" to it.  What happens?  Can we change this image to another one?  Look at
  app/assets/stylesheets/landing.css.  Scroll to the bottom of the file and see what you find.  Try to 
  change this image to an image of yourself?

Extra (Do this is was way too easy for you):
  Try to refractor the code so that we don't have to repeat the navbar in both the about and the home page.
  Take a look at the layouts folder under views to get a clue on how to do this.
